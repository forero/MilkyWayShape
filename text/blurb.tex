We use a large N-body simulation dubbed \verb"Bolshoi". The data in
this paper is available to the public throug a
database \footnote{\texttt{http://www.multidark.org/MultiDark/MyDB}}
presented by \cite{Riebe:2011gp}. The \verb"Bolshoi" simulation follows 
the non-linear evolution of dark matter density field in a cubic
volume of side $250$\hMpc sampled with $2048^3$ particles. The code
adaptive mesh refinment code ART was used  \citep{Klypin09}. A detailed
description of this simulation can be found in \cite{Klypin:2010qw}.

The cosmological parameters are compatible with the results from the
fifth and seventh year of data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe \citep{Komatsu2009,Jarosik2011}, with $\Omega_m=0.27$,
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$, $n_{s}=0.95$, $h=0.70$ and $\sigma_8=0.82$
for the matter density, dark energy density, slope of the matter
fluctuations, the Hubble constant at $z=0$ in units of 100km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ and the normalization of the power spectrum. The mass of a
simulation particle is $m_p = 1.4\times 10^{8}$\hMsun. 


\subsection{Halo finding}

We use halos that were defined using the Bound Density Maxima (BDM)
algorithm \citep{KlypinBDM}. The first step in the algorithm is
finding the density at the particles' positions in the simulation
around which spheres of radius $R$ are built to contain a mass
overdensity $M_{\Delta} = \frac{4\pi}{3}\Delta \rho_{\rm
  cr}(z)R_{\Delta}^{3}$, where $\rho_{\rm}$ is the critical density of
the Universe and $\Delta$ is a desired overdensity threshold. We use
the results obtained for $\Delta=200$.


\subsection{Concentration and shape measurements}

The concentration values reported in the database are computed for an
spherical NFW profile.  The estimation uses an analytical property of
the NFW profile that related the circular velocity at the virial radius

\begin{equation}
V_{200} = \left(\frac{GM_{200}}{R_{200}}\right)^{1/2},
\end{equation}

and the maximum circular velocity 

\begin{equation}
V_{\rm max}^{2} = {\rm max}\left[\frac{GM(<r)}{r}\right].
\end{equation}





%\subsection{Concentration estimates}

%The estimation for the concentration values is done using an
%analytical property of the NFW profile (see Sect.\,\ref{SL_Ana}) that relates the circular
%velocity at the virial radius:
%\begin{equation}
%V_{200} = \left(\frac{GM_{200}}{R_{200}}\right)^{1/2},
%\end{equation}
%with the maximum circular velocity 
%\begin{equation}
%V_{\rm max}^{2} = {\rm max}\left[\frac{GM(<r)}{r}\right].
%\end{equation}


%The $V_{\rm max}/V_{200}$ velocity ratio is used to determine the halo
%concentration, $c$ (the ratio between $R_{200}$ and the scale radii of
%the NFW profile), using the following relation \citep{Bolshoi}:

%\begin{equation}
%\frac{V_{\rm max}}{V_{200}} = \left(\frac{0.216 c}{c}\right)^{1/2}
%\end{equation}

%where $f(c)$ is
%\begin{equation}
%f(x) = \ln(1+c) - \frac{c}{(1+c)}.
%\end{equation}

%For each BDM overdensity the $V_{\rm max}/V_{200}$ ratio in order to
%find the concentration $c$ by solving numerically the previous two
%equations.  This method provides a robust estimate of the concentration
%compared to a radial fitting to the NFW profile, which is strongly
%dependent on the radial range used for the fit
%\citep{Bolshoi,Meneghetti13}. Comparison of these two methods to
%using halos where the NFW functional fit yield a small systematic
%offset of $(5-15)\%$, with the concentration  derived by the velocity
%ratio method being higher \citep{Prada12}.
